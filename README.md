# Benchmarking code and results from NIST STS, Dieharder, TestU01 and ENT tests.

Results used for the conference article are under the in the "original" folder.

Modifications used for benchmarking:  
STS - stsassess: custom code to run the battery with command line parameters. (instead of the regular "assess") also modified Makefile to accomodate this.  
Dieharder - enabled debug flag.  
TestU01 - Utest.c to run tests from the Alphabit and SmallCrush batteries.  

Edit and run execute_all.py
